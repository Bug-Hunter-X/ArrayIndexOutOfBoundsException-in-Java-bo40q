This repository demonstrates a common Java error: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The 'Bug.java' file contains code that attempts to access an array element beyond its valid index. The 'Solution.java' file provides a corrected version that avoids this error.  The bug is caused by the loop condition 'i <= arr.length', which allows the loop to iterate one time too many.  Array indices are zero-based.
